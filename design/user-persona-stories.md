#### Occupation 
Student
#### Condition
**Congenital blindness**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_blindness
#### Study History
Graduated Highschool
Attempted Bachelor of Computing (software engineering from 2022-2024) at university, but struggled with the mathematical components, and the associated cost, so switched to TAFE in July of 2025
#### Wants
To study software, coding and tech, likes the automation of tasks using code.
want to be able to use the same resources as his TAFE peers.
#### Need
ability to get text from images
Uses a windows screen reader to help parse onscreen text. Prefered screen reader is JAWS https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/
#### Goal
John’s overarching goal is to achieve independence both personally and professionally. Living with congenital blindness, he has spent much of his life relying on others for everyday tasks, study assistance, and navigating unfamiliar environments. While he values the support he receives, he also feels a strong internal drive to prove to himself that he can succeed on his own terms.

For John, completing his TAFE Diploma in Software Engineering represents more than just gaining a qualification, its how he sees himself achieving self sufficiency. He sees software development as an equalising field, one where accessibility tools allow him to compete on a level playing field. Writing code gives him a sense of control and empowerment: he can automate repetitive tasks, create tools that assist others, and solve problems independently without waiting for help.

Ultimately, John wants to build a career where his skills, not his disability, define him. Independence for him means being able to study, work, and live confidently in a world not always designed with accessibility in mind and using his technical skills to solve real-world problems. 

In the context of his study, he wants to be able to study the same course content as his TAFE peers, including coding tutorial videos that traditionally, he would not be able to properly view and learn from. 

# User Stories

**As a** TAFE software student who uses JAWS
**I want** to be able to use a coding video tutorial as a learning tool the same way as my classmates do. 
**So that** I can achieve the same learning outcomes without needing special lecturer attention. 

**As a**  TAFE software student who uses JAWS  
**I want** to pause a coding tutorial video and get screen-reader-ready OCR/alt-text of the current frame. 
**So that** I can understand on-screen code and video context better, or in other words, use video resources that my class mates are using to help them understand in class concepts.
